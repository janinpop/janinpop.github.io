I'm a post-doctoral researcher in **instrumental astronomy**, with a deep love for **physics**, **mathematics**, and **computers** — and an equally strong passion for **sport**.  
Whether I'm developing high-precision instruments or out trail running, climbing, or on a bike, I’m always chasing performance, balance, and new challenges.

This site brings together my professional work and the things that keep me curious (and moving).  
You’ll find:

- 📝 [Research papers](./publications/)
- 🎤 [Talks and presentations](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)
- ⚙️ [Side projects & hobbies](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)
