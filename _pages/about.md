I'm a post-doctoral researcher in **instrumental astronomy**, with a deep love for **physics**, **mathematics**, and **computers** â€” and an equally strong passion for **sport**.  
Whether I'm developing high-precision instruments or out trail running, climbing, or on a bike, Iâ€™m always chasing performance, balance, and new challenges.
