We proposed a theoretical and practical reflection on the conditions for the emergence of thoughts and forms located at the crossroads of the arts and sciences. Based on a research-creation approach, we question the modalities and purposes of transdisciplinary collaborations, beyond the utilitarian relationships where art and science mutually serve each other. The action seminar entitled “The Tool, at the Crossroads of the Arts and Sciences”, held at the Fondation des Treilles in October 2024, brought together eight artists and eight scientists from various disciplines. The founding hypothesis of the project considers that the identification, sharing and experimentation of tools, both material and immaterial, can foster a true resonance between artistic and scientific practices. The seminar gave rise to oral presentations followed by concrete experiments, bringing into play the tools brought by the participants and leading to hybrid forms. These practices aim to establish a space for transdisciplinary fundamental research, conducive to exploration, creative wandering, and the questioning of normative frameworks for knowledge production. A collective publication will report on this experience, with a desire to document the emerging forms of the encounter between art and science.
