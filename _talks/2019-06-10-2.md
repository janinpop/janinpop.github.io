The development and study of new, more robust and powerful wavefront sensors plays an important role in
the improvement of the wavefront sensing capabilities of adaptive optics systems. The LAM-ONERA On-sky
Pyramid Sensor is a R&amp;D bench dedicated to study and characterize these new wavefront sensors. In this paper,
we give a glance at the current status of the bench in terms of hardware and at the most recent results obtained
using new flavours of Fourier filtering wavefront sensors.
