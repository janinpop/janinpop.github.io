excerpt: 'The SPEED project - the Segmented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet Detection - in development at the Lagrange laboratory, aims at gearing up strategies and technologies for high-contrast instrumentation with segmented telescopes. This new instrumental platform offers an ideal environment in which to make progress in the domain of ELTs and/or space-based missions with complex apertures. It combines all the required recipes (phasing optics, wavefront control/shaping, and advanced coronagraphy) to get to very close angular separation imaging. In this paper, we report on the optical design and subsystems advances and we provide a progress overview.'

The SPEED project - the Segmented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet Detection - in development at the Lagrange laboratory, aims at gearing up strategies and technologies for high-contrast instrumentation with segmented telescopes. This new instrumental platform offers an ideal environment in which to make progress in the domain of ELTs and/or space-based missions with complex apertures. It combines all the required recipes (phasing optics, wavefront control/shaping, and advanced coronagraphy) to get to very close angular separation imaging. In this paper, we report on the optical design and subsystems advances and we provide a progress overview.
