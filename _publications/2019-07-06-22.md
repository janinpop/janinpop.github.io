title: "Adaptive optics with programmable Fourier-based wavefront sensors: a spatial light modulator approach to the LAM/ONERA on-sky pyramid sensor testbed"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-07-06-22
excerpt: 'Wavefront sensors (WFSs) encode phase information of an incoming
wavefront into an intensity pattern that can be measured on a camera.
Several kinds of WFSs are used in astronomical adaptive optics. Among
them, Fourier-based WFSs perform a filtering operation on the wavefront
in the focal plane. The most well-known example of a WFS of this kind is
the Zernike WFS. The pyramid WFS also belongs to this class. Based on
this same principle, WFSs can be proposed, such as the n-faced pyramid
(which ultimately becomes an axicon) or the flattened pyramid, depending
on whether the image formation is incoherent or coherent. To test such
concepts, the LAM/ONERA on-sky pyramid sensor (LOOPS) adaptive optics
testbed hosted at the Laboratoire d&apos;Astrophysique de Marseille has been
upgraded by adding a spatial light modulator (SLM). This device, placed
in a focal plane produces high-definition phase masks that mimic
otherwise bulk optic devices. We first present the optical design and
upgrades made to the experimental setup of the LOOPS bench. Then, we
focus on the generation of the phase masks with the SLM and the
implications of having such a device in a focal plane. Finally, we
present the first closed-loop results in either static or dynamic mode
with different WFS applied on the SLM.'
