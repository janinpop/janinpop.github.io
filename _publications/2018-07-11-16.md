title: "The segmented pupil experiment for exoplanet detection: Part 3. Advances and first light with segments cophasing"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-07-11-16
excerpt: 'SPEED (Segmented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet Detection) is an instrumental testbed designed to offer an ideal cocoon to provide relevant solutions in both cophasing and high-contrast imaging with segmented telescopes. The next generation of observatories will be made of a primary mirror with excessive complexity (mirror segmentation, central obscuration, and spider vanes) undoubtedly known to be unfavorable for the direct detection of exoplanets. Exoplanets detection around late-type stars (M-dwarfs) constitutes an outstanding reservoir of candidates, and SPEED integrates all the recipes to pave the road for this science case (cophasing sensors, multi-DM wavefront control and shaping architecture as well as advanced coronagraphy). In this paper, we provide a progress overview of the project and report on the first light with segments cophasing control and monitoring from a coronagraphic image.'
