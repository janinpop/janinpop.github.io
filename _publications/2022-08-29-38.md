excerpt: 'Extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems require high spatial and temporal sampling of wavefronts to optimize performance, and as a result, require large detectors for the wavefront sensor (WFS). We present a testbed demonstration of a three-sided pyramid wavefront sensor (3PWFS) as an alternative to the conventional four-sided pyramid wavefront sensor (4PWFS) for Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope ExAO applications. The 3PWFS is less sensitive to read noise than the 4PWFS because it uses fewer detector pixels. We describe the design of the Comprehensive Adaptive Optics and Coronagraph Test Instrument (CACTI). An experiment was performed on CACTI to determine the relative performance of the 3PWFS to the 4PWFS in varying strengths of turbulence using both the Raw Intensity and Slopes Map signal processing methods. We found that the performance of the two WFS is comparable if modal loop gains are tuned.
