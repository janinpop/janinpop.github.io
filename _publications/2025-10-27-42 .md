excerpt: 'As the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) approaches operational status, optimizing its imaging performance is critical. Differential piston, whether arising from the adaptive optics control loop, thermomechanical effects or other sources, significantly degrades image quality and is deletarious for the telescope performances. In a numerical simulation environment, we propose a method to estimate the differential piston between the petals of the ELT’s M4 mirror using images from a $2\times2$ Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELTs tomographic adaptive optics mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise. Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we train a neural network on simulated datasets to estimate differential piston. The robustness of the method is assessed under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. Performance is quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration. The method demonstrates the ability to extract differential piston information from $2\times2$ SH-WFS images. Temporal averaging of frames makes the differential piston signal emerge from the turbulence-induced speckle field and leads to a significant improvement in RMSE performance. As expected, better seeing conditions result in improved accuracy. Polychromaticity only degrades performance by less than $5\%$ compared to the monochromatic case. In a realistic scenario, detector noise is not the limiting factor as the primary limitation rather arises from the need for sufficient speckle averaging. The network is also shown to be applicable to input images other than $2\times2$ SH-WFS data.'

As the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) approaches operational status, optimizing its imaging performance is critical. Differential piston, whether arising from the adaptive optics control loop, thermomechanical effects or other sources, significantly degrades image quality and is deletarious for the telescope performances. 
In a numerical simulation environment, we propose a method to estimate the differential piston between the petals of the ELT’s M4 mirror using images from a $2\times2$ Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELT's tomographic adaptive optics mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise.
Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we train a neural network on simulated datasets to estimate differential piston. The robustness of the method is assessed under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. Performance is quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration.
