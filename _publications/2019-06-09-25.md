title: "Model-based wavefront reconstruction for the pyramid sensor tested on the LOOPS bench"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-06-09-25
excerpt: 'Model-based matrix-free wavefront reconstruction algorithms have proven to provide highly accurate results for both Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront sensors in various simulation environments (OCTOPUS, YAO, COMPASS, OOMAO). Previously, test bench as well as on-sky tests were performed with the CuReD for the Shack-Hartmann sensor providing a convincing performance level together with highly reduced computational efforts. The P-CuReD is a method with linear complexity for wavefront reconstruction from pyramid sensor data which employs the CuReD algorithm and a data preprocessing step converting pyramid signals into Shack-Hartmann-like data. Here we present experimental results for the pyramid sensor being controlled with the P-CuReD on the LOOPS test bench of the Laboratoire d&apos;Astrophysique de Marseille. Through the example of the P-CuReD a comparison of control using matrix-free Fourier domain based methods to standard interaction-matrix-based approaches is provided.'
