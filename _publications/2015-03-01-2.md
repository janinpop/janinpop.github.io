title: "The SPEED Project: SPEEDing up Research and Development towards High-contrast Imaging Instruments for the E-ELT"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-03-01-2
excerpt: 'An overview is presented of the Seg-
mented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet
Detection (SPEED) testbench. This is an
advanced facility in development at the
Lagrange Laboratory that will address
several of the most critical issues
affecting high-contrast imaging for the
next generation of optical/near-infrared
telescopes. The SPEED testbed can be
used to investigate practical solutions
for broadband coronography on asym-
metric, unfriendly apertures, enabling
algorithmic or optical approaches to be
developed to minimise segment effects
and pupil discontinuity.'
