Astrophysical observations from earth-based telescopes are affected by the atmosphere turbulences. The angular resolution of these instruments is therefore highly reduced. Adaptive Optics (AO) allows, by estimating the wavrefront deformations thanks to a WaveFront Sensor (WFS) and correcting it with one or more Deformable Mirror(s) (DM), to restore the optical performances.

From the beginning of the 90s and until recently, the AO dispositives have been using Shack-Hartman WFS. New WFS based on optical Fourier filtering (such as the Zernike or pyramid WFS) are now starting to being used while still under study and development. A mathematical formalism of these kind of WFS has been proposed and deeply formalized in O. Fauvarque's thesis, opening the path toward a better formal comprehension of their operation (especially in terms of sensitivity and linearity) and therefor a way to develop new WFS.

The transposition of this theoretical work into real-life implementation and testing will be done at Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) on the pre-existing AO bench entitled LOOPS (standing for LAM-ONERA On-sky Pyramid Sensor). For now on, the bench can operate in closed-loop conditions using a 4-sides glass pyramid, a turbulence simulator and a Boston DM (12x12 actuators). Actually under upgrade, the bench is receiving a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) in order to produce all flavours of WFS. The SLM is a high-resolution LCD display (~1k x 1k pixels) capable of producing arbitrary phase screen that will modify the wavefront. This versatile instrument allows, for example, the creation of pyramids with variable number of faces (see Fig. 1) as well as adjustable faces angles (see Fig. 2), opening the way to innovative and hopefully more powerful WFS designs. Sensitivity and linearity measurements of new WFSs (inspired from the pyramid WFS) will be presented and compared to the results obtained in simulations. The complete setup of the LOOPS bench will also be given to provide an exact overview of the on-going the community.

The development and study of new, more robust and powerful wavefront sensors plays an important role in
the improvement of the wavefront sensing capabilities of adaptive optics systems. The LAM-ONERA On-sky
Pyramid Sensor is a R&D bench dedicated to study and characterize these new wavefront sensors. In this paper,
we give a glance at the current status of the bench in terms of hardware and at the most recent results obtained
using new flavours of Fourier filtering wavefront sensors."

 Linearity, sensitivity and dynamic are the trinity of adaptive optics (AO). A wavefront sensor ex- celling in both these three domains is the Holy Grail for AO scientists. The first integrations of Fourier-based wavefront sensors (F-WFS, like Zernike, Pyramid, etc.) in AO systems show that these devices are capable of high performances and are therefore establishing themselves as the new standard. They are as well very modular objects that can be tuned to improve their func- tioning regime regarding linearity, sensitivity and dynamic. In order to develop our knowledge, deliver the best performances fromAO systems and proposenew insights on F-WFS, we developed the versatile AO testbed called LOOPS. On this bench we can now control: (1) the phase of the Fourier filtering mask in the focal plane, allowing to produce any flavor of WFS (3-faced, 4-faced, n-faced pyramids / Ingot / axicone / Zernike / iQuad etc.) (2) the turbulence in the pupil plane, allowing to reproduce several observing conditions (r0, wind speed, power spectral density) (3) the tip-tilt modulation in the pupil plane, allowing to modulate the PWFS in the classical way or produce arbitrary shaped objects like elongated LGS spots Using data obtained from the bench, we present a complete and clear static comparison of different F-WFS in terms of linearity, sensitivity and dynamic. In a second time, we show the performances of the chosen F-WFS in closed-loop operation in terms of bootstrap and residuals RMS capacities.

Enhancing space surveillance through the Unistellar collaborative observation program	Poster	4	SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation	2024-06-17	Yokohama, Japan		"[View poster](/files/poster_dossa_SPIE.pdf)

The DOSSA (Decentralization of Space Situational Awareness) project, led by SpaceAble in collaboration with Unistellar and the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille, aims to enhance space surveillance through a collaborative effort involving amateur astronomers, researchers, and industrial networks, leveraging advanced technology and data collection to improve space situational awareness in an era of escalating satellite numbers. This project aims to create a comprehensive sky map of objects transiting around Earth. It benefits from a large dataset collected by the Unistellar telescope network, a global network comprised primarily of robotically controllable evScopes 1 and 2 telescopes, each featuring a 11.4 centimeter aperture diameter. We develop dedicated deep learning algorithms to account for the relatively compact diameters of the telescopes and to extend detection thresholds. Firstly, we use traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based classifiers to detect images including a satellite streak, and secondly, we use UNet to identify pixels affected by such streaks. Both neural networks are trained on realistic simulations generated using our optical Fourier simulation software, by combining observed sky backgrounds and synthetic satellite streaks spanning a wide range of orbital parameters. With this strategy, we reach excellent performance on the segmentation of images in test set, with a recall of 79.6\% pixels belonging to the satellites masks, at a false positive rate of 0.001%. For 90% of streak pixels recovered by the neural networks, we obtain a precision of 96.3% on the predicted satellite masks. This exceeds the performance of non-ML algorithms and paves the way to measuring accurate satellite positions over broader magnitudes ranges and down to lower S/N, in order to increase the precision on their orbital parameters.

Advancements in estimating differential pistons for the extremely large telescope using deep learning	Poster	5	SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation	2024-06-17	Yokohama, Japan		"[View poster](/files/poster_petaling_SPIE.pdf)

As the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) nears operational status, the focus is made on maximizing its capabilities to produce the best possible images.
Among other influential factors, the differential pistons – caused by the joint presence of spiders breaking the spatial continuity of the wavefront and low-order aberrations from various origins – significantly impact the overall image quality and must therefore be addressed.
Our study is centered on utilizing Neural Networks (NN) to accurately estimate the ELT's six differential pistons in the presence of turbulence residuals using a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS). The results of this work could be applied to instruments like HARMONI or MORFEO, which will be equipped with 2x2 SHWFS for their natural guide star wavefront sensing.
In our earlier work, the use of ResNet networks fed with data covering all pupil/SHWFS rotation angles demonstrated success in piston estimation. In that study, a simplified atmospheric turbulence model was employed, consisting solely of turbulence residuals, implying perfect correction for frequencies below the deformable mirror's cutoff frequency.
In this paper, we propose to evaluate the network's performance under more realistic atmospheric turbulence conditions relevant to the ELT.
We show that the network can still extract differential piston information from single-frame images, while exhibiting increased uncertainty in its estimation. However, using 10-frame averaged images leads to a significant improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) performance. We conclude this work by addressing remaining open questions and outlining potential future research directions. These findings contribute to refining the NN models usage for cophasing applications, addressing alignment challenges, and enhancing ELT instrumentation performance.
