2015-01-01	Self-Coherent Camera as a focal plane phasing sensor-Overview and early comparison with the Zernike Phase Contrast Sensor	Adaptive Optics for Extremely Large Telescopes 4–Conference Proceedings	In order to achieve the high performance required for the astronomical science programs with coming Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), the errors due to segment misalignment must be reduced to tens of nm. Therefore the development of new co-phasing techniques is of critical importance for ground-based telescopes, and to a large extent for future space-based missions. We propose a new co-phasing method directly exploiting the scientific image delivered by the Self-Coherent Camera (SCC) by adequately combining segment misalignment estimators (piston and tip/tilt) and image processing. The Self-Coherent Camera Phasing Sensor (SCC-PS) is shown to be capable of estimating accurately and simultaneously piston and tip/tilt misalignments and to correct them in close-loop operation in a few iterations. By contrast to several phasing sensor concepts the SCC-PS does not require any a priori on the signal at the segment boundaries, or a dedicated optical path. The SCC-PS is a non-invasive concept that works directly on the scientific image of the instrument, either in a coronagrahic or a non-coronagraphic observing mode. The primary results obtained in this study are very promising and demonstrate that the SCC-PS is a serious candidate for segment co-phasing at the instrument level or at the telescope level for both ground- and space-based applications. Applications of the estimators and algorithm developed for the SCC-PS seem to be possible to other on-segment aberration measurement. Early studies are already in progress to adapt these processes.

2015-01-01	System analysis of the Segmented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet Detection-SPEED-in view of the ELTs	Adaptive Optics for Extremely Large Telescopes 4–Conference Proceedings	SPEED is a new experiment in progress at the Lagrange laboratory to study some critical aspects to succeed invery deep high-contrast imaging at close angular separations with the next generation of ELTs. The SPEEDbench will investigate optical, system, and algorithmic approaches to minimize the ELT primary mirrordiscontinuities and achieve the required contrast for targeting low mass exoplanets. The SPEED projectcombines high precision co-phasing architectures, wavefront control and shaping using two sequential high orderdeformable mirrors, and advanced coronagraphy (PIAACMC). In this paper, we describe the overall systemarchitecture and discuss some characteristics to reach 10-7 contrast at roughly 1λ/D.

2016-05-23	The self-coherent camera as a focal plane fine phasing sensor	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. Direct imaging of Earth-like exoplanets requires very high contrast imaging capability and high angular resolution. Primary
mirror segmentation is a key technological solution for large-aperture telescopes because it opens the path toward significantly in-
creasing the angular resolution. The segments are kept aligned by an active optics system that must reduce segment misalignments
below tens of nm rms to achieve the high optical quality required for astronomical science programs.
Aims. The development of cophasing techniques is mandatory for the next generation of space- and ground-based segmented tele-
scopes, which both share the need for increasing spatial resolution. We propose a new focal plane cophasing sensor that exploits the
scientific image of a coronagraphic instrument to retrieve simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments.
Methods. The self-coherent camera phasing sensor (SCC-PS) adequately combines the SCC properties to segmented telescope archi-
tectures with adapted segment misalignment estimators and image processing. An overview of the system architecture, and a thorough
performance and sensitivity analysis, including a closed-loop efficiency, are presented by means of numerical simulations.
Results. The SCC-PS estimates simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments and corrects them in closed-loop operation in a few
iterations. As opposed to numerous phasing sensor concepts the SCC-PS does not require any a priori on the signal at the segment
boundaries or any dedicated optical path. We show that the SCC-PS has a moderate sensitivity to misalignments, virtually none to
pupil shear, and is by principle insensitive to segment gaps and edge effects. Primary mirror phasing can be achieved with a relatively
bright natural guide star with the SCC-PS.
Conclusions. The SCC-PS is a noninvasive concept and an efficient phasing sensor from the image domain. It is an attractive candidate
for segment cophasing at the instrument level or alternatively at the telescope level, as usually envisioned in current space- and ground-
based observatories."	"P. Janin-Potiron, P. Martinez, P. Baudoz and M. Carbillet

2016-07-27	The Segmented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet Detection: 2. design advances and progress overview	Ground-based and Airborne Telescopes VI	The SPEED project - the Segmented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet Detection - in development at the Lagrange laboratory, aims at gearing up strategies and technologies for high-contrast instrumentation with segmented telescopes. This new instrumental platform offers an ideal environment in which to make progress in the domain of ELTs and/or space-based missions with complex apertures. It combines all the required recipes (phasing optics, wavefront control/shaping, and advanced coronagraphy) to get to very close angular separation imaging. In this paper, we report on the optical design and subsystems advances and we provide a progress overview.	"P. Martinez, M. Beaulieu, P. Janin-Potiron, O. Preis, C. Gouvret, J. Dejonghe, L. Abe, A.

2016-07-27	The self-coherent camera-phasing sensor: from numerical simulations to early experiments	Ground-based and Airborne Telescopes VI	Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are the next technological step when considering astrophysical observation. They will provide unprecedented angular resolution, thus improving the imaging capability and hopefully allow the imaging of the first Earth-like exoplanet. For technological and mechanical reasons, the primary mirror of these instruments will have to be segmented. To reach the image quality needed for the most demanding observational programs, the segments must be kept aligned below tens of nm RMS. The development of cophasing technics is of prime importance for the next generation of space- and ground-based segmented telescopes. We propose to describe in this paper a new focal plane cophasing sensor that exploits the scientific image of a coronagraphic instrument to retrieve simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments. It is based on the self- coherent camera (SCC) principle and provides a non-invasive system and an efficient phasing sensor from the image domain. Numerical simulations have successfully demonstrated the proper functioning of this system and its algorithms. Along this, work to implement and test the self-coherent camera - phasing sensor (SCC-PS) is currently ongoing and a first look at the cophasing stage of the Segmented Pupil Experiment for Exoplanet Detection (SPEED) will be proposed.

2016-09-01	Laser-guide-stars used for cophasing broad capture ranges	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. Segmented primary mirrors are indispensable to master the steady increase in spatial resolution. Phasing optics systems must reduce segment misalignments to guarantee the high optical quality required for astronomical science programs.
Aims. Modern telescopes routinely use adaptive optics systems to compensate for the atmosphere and use laser-guide-stars to create artificial stars as bright references in the field of observation. Because multiple laser-guide-star adaptive optics are being implemented in all major observatories, we propose to use man-made stars not only for adaptive optics, but for phasing optics.
Methods. We propose a method called the doublet-wavelength coherence technique (DWCT), exploiting the D lines of sodium in the mesosphere using laser guide-stars. The signal coherence properties are then used.
Results. The DWCT capture range exceeds current abilities by a factor of 100. It represents a change in paradigm by improving the phasing optics capture range from micrometric to millimetric. It thereby potentially eliminates the need of a man-made mechanical pre-phasing step.
Conclusions. Extremely large telescopes require hundreds of segments, several of which need to be substituted on a daily basis to be recoated. The DWCT relaxes mechanical integration requirements and speeds up integration and re-integration process.

2017-07-01	Fine cophasing of segmented aperture telescopes with ZELDA, a Zernike wavefront sensor in the diffraction-limited regime	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. Segmented aperture telescopes require an alignment procedure with successive steps from coarse alignment to monitoring process in order to provide very high optical quality images for stringent science operations such as exoplanet imaging. The final step, referred to as fine phasing, calls for a high sensitivity wavefront sensing and control system in a diffraction-limited regime to achieve segment alignment with nanometric accuracy. In this context, Zernike wavefront sensors represent promising options for such a calibration. A concept called the Zernike unit for segment phasing (ZEUS) was previously developed for ground-based applications to operate under seeing-limited images. Such a concept is, however, not suitable for fine cophasing with diffraction-limited images.
Aims. We revisit ZELDA, a Zernike sensor that was developed for the measurement of residual aberrations in exoplanet direct imagers, to measure segment piston, tip, and tilt in the diffraction-limited regime.
Methods. We introduce a novel analysis scheme of the sensor signal that relies on piston, tip, and tilt estimators for each segment, and provide probabilistic insights to predict the success of a closed-loop correction as a function of the initial wavefront error.
Results. The sensor unambiguously and simultaneously retrieves segment piston and tip-tilt misalignment. Our scheme allows for correction of these errors in closed-loop operation down to nearly zero residuals in a few iterations. This sensor also shows low sensitivity to misalignment of its parts and high ability for operation with a relatively bright natural guide star.
Conclusions. Our cophasing sensor relies on existing mask technologies that make the concept already available for segmented apertures in future space missions.

2017-09-01	Discovery of a warm, dusty giant planet around HIP 65426	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Aims. The SHINE program is a high-contrast near-infrared survey of 600 young, nearby stars aimed at searching for and characterizing new planetary systems using VLT/SPHERE’s unprecedented high-contrast and high-angular-resolution imaging capabilities. It is also intended to place statistical constraints on the rate, mass and orbital distributions of the giant planet population at large orbits as a function of the stellar host mass and age to test planet-formation theories.
Methods. We used the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE to acquire high-contrast coronagraphic differential near-infrared images and spectra of the young A2 star HIP 65426. It is a member of the ~17 Myr old Lower Centaurus-Crux association.
Results. At a separation of 830 mas (92 au projected) from the star, we detect a faint red companion. Multi-epoch observations confirm that it shares common proper motion with HIP 65426. Spectro-photometric measurements extracted with IFS and IRDIS between 0.95 and 2.2 μm indicate a warm, dusty atmosphere characteristic of young low-surface-gravity L5-L7 dwarfs. Hot-start evolutionary models predict a luminosity consistent with a 6–12 MJup, Teff = 1300–1600 K and R = 1.5 ± 0.1 RJup giant planet. Finally, the comparison with Exo-REM and PHOENIX BT-Settl synthetic atmosphere models gives consistent effective temperatures but with slightly higher surface gravity solutions of log (g) = 4.0–5.0 with smaller radii (1.0–1.3 RJup).
Conclusions. Given its physical and spectral properties, HIP 65426 b occupies a rather unique placement in terms of age, mass, and spectral-type among the currently known imaged planets. It represents a particularly interesting case to study the presence of clouds as a function of particle size, composition, and location in the atmosphere, to search for signatures of non-equilibrium chemistry, and finally to test the theory of planet formation and evolution.

2017-10-01	Correction active des discontinuités pupillaires des télescopes à miroir segmenté pour l’imagerie haut contraste et la haute résolution angulaire	Thèse de doctorat	La recherche de signes de vie extraterrestre par l'observation et la caractérisation d'exoplanètes est, entre autres, l'un des enjeux majeurs de l'astrophysique moderne. Cette quête se traduit de manière instrumentale par le développement de télescopes fournissant des résolutions angulaires supérieures à celles obtenues à l'heure actuelle. C'est pourquoi les projets de futurs très grands télescopes font usage de miroirs primaires dépassant les 30 mètres de diamètre. Leur conception est alors inévitablement basée, pour des raisons techniques et technologiques, sur une géométrie segmentée. De ce fait, la segmentation du miroir primaire implique une complexification des structures pupillaires du télescope. Dans le but d'atteindre les niveaux de qualité optique nécessaires aux applications scientifiques visées, la prise en compte et la correction des effets introduits par un mauvais alignement des segments est de prime importance puisque la résolution angulaire d'un télescope non cophasé serait équivalente à celle obtenue avec un segment individuel. Dans ce contexte, je développe dans cette thèse deux analyseurs de cophasage permettant de mesurer et de corriger les aberrations de piston, tip et tilt présentes sur une pupille segmentée. Le premier, nommé Self-Coherent Camera - Phasing Sensor (SCC-PS), est basé sur une analyse du signal en plan focal. Le second, nommé ZELDA - Phasing Sensor (ZELDA-PS), repose quant à lui sur une analyse du signal en plan pupille. Sont présentés dans ce manuscrit les résultats obtenus à l'aide de simulations numériques ainsi que ceux issus de l'implémentation de la SCC-PS sur un banc d'optique d'essai.		12	https://theses.fr/2017AZUR4078

2018-09-01	Investigating the young solar system analog HD 95086-A combined HARPS and SPHERE exploration	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. HD 95086 (A8V, 17 Myr) hosts a rare planetary system for which a multi-belt debris disk and a giant planet of 4–5 MJup have been directly imaged.
Aims. Our study aims to characterize the global architecture of this young system using the combination of radial velocity and direct imaging observations. We want to characterize the physical and orbital properties of HD 95086 b, search for additional planets at short and wide orbits and image the cold outer debris belt in scattered light.
Methods. We used HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m telescope to monitor the radial velocity of HD 95086 over two years and investigate the existence of giant planets at less than 3 au orbital distance. With the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE at VLT, we imaged the faint circumstellar environment beyond 10 au at six epochs between 2015 and 2017.
Results. We do not detect additional giant planets around HD 95086. We identify the nature (bound companion or background contaminant) of all point-like sources detected in the IRDIS field of view. None of them correspond to the ones recently discovered near the edge of the cold outer belt by ALMA. HD 95086 b is resolved for the first time in J-band with IFS. Its near-infrared spectral energy distribution is well fitted by a few dusty and/or young L7–L9 dwarf spectral templates. The extremely red 1–4 μm spectral distribution is typical of low-gravity objects at the L/T spectral type transition. The planet’s orbital motion is resolved between January 2015 and May 2017. Together with past NaCo measurements properly re-calibrated, our orbital fitting solutions favor a retrograde low to moderate-eccentricity orbit e = 0.2+0.3−0.2, with a semi-major axis ~52 au corresponding to orbital periods of ~288 yr and an inclination that peaks at i = 141°, which is compatible with a planet-disk coplanar configuration. Finally, we report the detection in polarimetric differential imaging of the cold outer debris belt between 100 and 300 au, consistent in radial extent with recent ALMA 1.3 mm resolved observations.

2018-06-01	Observations of fast-moving features in the debris disk of AU Mic on a three-year timescale: Confirmation and new discoveries	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. The nearby and young M star AU Mic is surrounded by a debris disk in which we previously identified a series of large-scale arch-like structures that have never been seen before in any other debris disk and that move outward at high velocities.
Aims. We initiated a monitoring program with the following objectives: (1) track the location of the structures and better constrain their projected speeds, (2) search for new features emerging closer in, and ultimately (3) understand the mechanism responsible for the motion and production of the disk features.
Methods. AU Mic was observed at 11 different epochs between August 2014 and October 2017 with the IR camera and spectrograph of SPHERE. These high-contrast imaging data were processed with a variety of angular, spectral, and polarimetric differential imaging techniques to reveal the faintest structures in the disk. We measured the projected separations of the features in a systematic way for all epochs. We also applied the very same measurements to older observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with the visible cameras STIS and ACS.
Results. The main outcomes of this work are (1) the recovery of the five southeastern broad arch-like structures we identified in our first study, and confirmation of their fast motion (projected speed in the range 4–12 km s−1); (2) the confirmation that the very first structures observed in 2004 with ACS are indeed connected to those observed later with STIS and now SPHERE; (3) the discovery of two new very compact structures at the northwest side of the disk (at 0.40′′ and 0.55′′ in May 2015) that move to the southeast at low speed; and (4) the identification of a new arch-like structure that might be emerging at the southeast side at about 0.4′′ from the star (as of May 2016).
Conclusions. Although the exquisite sensitivity of SPHERE allows one to follow the evolution not only of the projected separation, but also of the specific morphology of each individual feature, it remains difficult to distinguish between possible dynamical scenarios that may explain the observations. Understanding the exact origin of these features, the way they are generated, and their evolution over time is certainly a significant challenge in the context of planetary system formation around M stars.

2019-07-01	Kernel formalism applied to Fourier-based wave-front sensing in presence of residual phases	JOSA A	In this paper, we describe Fourier-based wave-front sensors (WFSs) as linear integral operators, characterized by their kernel. In the first part, we derive the dependency of this quantity with respect to the WFS’s optical parameters: pupil geometry, filtering mask, and tip/tilt modulation. In the second part, we focus the study on the special case of convolutional kernels. The assumptions required to be in such a regime are described. We then show that these convolutional kernels allow to drastically simplify the WFS model by summarizing its behavior in a concise and comprehensive quantity called the WFS impulse response. We explain in particular how it allows to compute the sensor’s sensitivity with respect to spatial frequencies. Such an approach therefore provides a fast diagnostic tool to compare and optimize Fourier-based WFSs. In the third part, we develop the impact of the residual phases on the sensor’s impulse response, and show that the convolutional model remains valid. Finally, a section dedicated to the pyramid WFS concludes this work and illustrates how the slope maps are easily handled by the convolutional model.

2019-05-01	Two cold belts in the debris disk around the G-type star NZ Lupi	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. Planetary systems hold the imprint of the formation and of the evolution of planets especially at young ages, and in particular at the stage when the gas has dissipated leaving mostly secondary dust grains. The dynamical perturbation of planets in the dust distribution can be revealed with high-contrast imaging in a variety of structures.
Aims. SPHERE, the high-contrast imaging device installed at the VLT, was designed to search for young giant planets in long period, but is also able to resolve fine details of planetary systems at the scale of astronomical units in the scattered-light regime. As a young and nearby star, NZ Lup was observed in the course of the SPHERE survey. A debris disk had been formerly identified with HST/NICMOS.
Methods. We observed this system in the near-infrared with the camera in narrow and broad band filters and with the integral field spectrograph. High contrasts are achieved by the mean of pupil tracking combined with angular differential imaging algorithms.
Results. The high angular resolution provided by SPHERE allows us to reveal a new feature in the disk which is interpreted as a superimposition of two belts of planetesimals located at stellocentric distances of ~85 and ~115 au, and with a mutual inclination of about 5°. Despite the very high inclination of the disk with respect to the line of sight, we conclude that the presence of a gap, that is, a void in the dust distribution between the belts, is likely.
Conclusions. We discuss the implication of the existence of two belts and their relative inclination with respect to the presence of planets.

2019-07-06	Adaptive optics with programmable Fourier-based wavefront sensors: a spatial light modulator approach to the LAM/ONERA on-sky pyramid sensor testbed	Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems	"Wavefront sensors (WFSs) encode phase information of an incoming
wavefront into an intensity pattern that can be measured on a camera.
Several kinds of WFSs are used in astronomical adaptive optics. Among
them, Fourier-based WFSs perform a filtering operation on the wavefront
in the focal plane. The most well-known example of a WFS of this kind is
the Zernike WFS. The pyramid WFS also belongs to this class. Based on
this same principle, WFSs can be proposed, such as the n-faced pyramid
(which ultimately becomes an axicon) or the flattened pyramid, depending
on whether the image formation is incoherent or coherent. To test such
concepts, the LAM/ONERA on-sky pyramid sensor (LOOPS) adaptive optics
testbed hosted at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille has been
upgraded by adding a spatial light modulator (SLM). This device, placed
in a focal plane produces high-definition phase masks that mimic
otherwise bulk optic devices. We first present the optical design and
upgrades made to the experimental setup of the LOOPS bench. Then, we
focus on the generation of the phase masks with the SLM and the
implications of having such a device in a focal plane. Finally, we
present the first closed-loop results in either static or dynamic mode

2019-06-01	First resolved observations of a highly asymmetric debris disc around HD 160305 with VLT/SPHERE	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. Direct imaging of debris discs gives important information about their nature, their global morphology, and allows us to identify specific structures possibly in connection with the presence of gravitational perturbers. It is the most straightforward technique to observe planetary systems as a whole.
Aims. We present the first resolved images of the debris disc around the young F-type star HD 160305, detected in scattered light using the VLT/SPHERE instrument in the near infrared.
Methods. We used a post-processing method based on angular differential imaging and synthetic images of debris discs produced with a disc modelling code (GRaTer) to constrain the main characteristics of the disc around HD 160305. All of the point sources in the field of the IRDIS camera were analysed with an astrometric tool to determine whether they are bound objects or background stars.
Results. We detect a very inclined (~82°) ring-like debris disc located at a stellocentric distance of about 86 au (deprojected width ~27 au). The disc displays a brightness asymmetry between the two sides of the major axis, as can be expected from scattering properties of dust grains. We derive an anisotropic scattering factor g > 0.5. A second right-left asymmetry is also observed with respect to the minor axis. We measure a surface brightness ratio of 0.73 ± 0.18 between the bright and the faint sides. Because of the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the images we cannot easily discriminate between several possible explanations for this left-right asymmetry, such as perturbations by an unseen planet, the aftermath of the breakup of a massive planetesimal, or the pericenter glow effect due to an eccentric ring. Two epochs of observations allow us to reject the companionship hypothesis for the 15 point sources present in the field.

2019-06-09	Model-based wavefront reconstruction for the pyramid sensor tested on the LOOPS bench	6th International Conference on Adaptive Optics for Extremely Large Telescopes, AO4ELT 2019	Model-based matrix-free wavefront reconstruction algorithms have proven to provide highly accurate results for both Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront sensors in various simulation environments (OCTOPUS, YAO, COMPASS, OOMAO). Previously, test bench as well as on-sky tests were performed with the CuReD for the Shack-Hartmann sensor providing a convincing performance level together with highly reduced computational efforts. The P-CuReD is a method with linear complexity for wavefront reconstruction from pyramid sensor data which employs the CuReD algorithm and a data preprocessing step converting pyramid signals into Shack-Hartmann-like data. Here we present experimental results for the pyramid sensor being controlled with the P-CuReD on the LOOPS test bench of the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille. Through the example of the P-CuReD a comparison of control using matrix-free Fourier domain based methods to standard interaction-matrix-based approaches is provided.

2020-12-13	Ingot wavefront sensor: from the Fourier End2End numerical simulation to the LOOPS test bench	Adaptive Optics Systems VII	"The Sodium Laser Guide Star (LGS) is an elongated object in a 3D volume. This produces a significant elongation
on many of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor spots that the ELT instruments use for wavefront sensing. The
Ingot Wavefront Sensor (I-WFS) has been proposed as a possible solution to deal with the 3D nature of the LGS.
We developed an end-to-end numerical tool of the I-WFS to perform system analysis of a closed-loop complete
system. We considered the generation of the input turbulence, deformable mirror definition and control, and,
of course details, of the I-WFS. It needs a 3-Dimensional description to fully take into account the elongation
effect across the vertical (propagation) axis. The I-WFS has been simulated similarly to the Pyramid Wavefront
Sensor, as a combination of Foucault knife-edge sensors. In parallel to numerical simulations development, we
had the opportunity to perform laboratory testing of the I-WFS at the LOOPS Adaptive Optics test bench (at
LAM), using a Spatial Light Modulator. This device is able to produce a high definition phase mask that can
mimic two-dimensional I-WFS behaviour. In this framework, we report a preliminary discussion both for the
simulations and the closed-loop data analysis."

2020-12-01	Pyramid wavefront sensor optical gains compensation using a convolutional model	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. Extremely large telescopes are overwhelmingly equipped with pyramid wavefront sensors (PyWFS) over the more widely used Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor to perform their single-conjugate adaptive optics (SCAO) mode. The PyWFS, a sensor based on Fourier filtering, has proven to be highly successful in many astronomy applications. However, this sensor exhibits non-linear behaviours that lead to a reduction of the sensitivity of the instrument when working with non-zero residual wavefronts. This so-called optical gains (OG) effect, degrades the closed-loop performance of SCAO systems and prevents accurate correction of non-common path aberrations (NCPA).
Aims. In this paper, we aim to compute the OG using a fast and agile strategy to control PyWFS measurements in adaptive optics closed-loop systems.
Methods. Using a novel theoretical description of PyWFS, which is based on a convolutional model, we are able to analytically predict the behaviour of the PyWFS in closed-loop operation. This model enables us to explore the impact of residual wavefront errors on particular aspects such as sensitivity and associated OG. The proposed method relies on the knowledge of the residual wavefront statistics and enables automatic estimation of the current OG. End-to-end numerical simulations are used to validate our predictions and test the relevance of our approach.
Results. We demonstrate, using on non-invasive strategy, that our method provides an accurate estimation of the OG. The model itself only requires adaptive optics telemetry data to derive statistical information on atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, we show that by only using an estimation of the current Fried parameter r0 and the basic system-level characteristics, OGs can be estimated with an accuracy of less than 10%. Finally, we highlight the importance of OG estimation in the case of NCPA compensation. The proposed method is applied to the PyWFS. However, it remains valid for any wavefront sensor based on Fourier filtering subject from OG variations.

2020-12-13	Injecting pupil binary intensity map into the laboratory adaptive optics bench using phase-only LCoS-SLM device	Adaptive Optics Systems VII	"Laboratory Adaptive Optics (AO) benches are the backbone of experimental testing and verification of new
AO designs and architectures. These testbeds are particularly important when exploring unknown factors in
the development of new instruments and facilities like future extremely large telescope AO systems. One of
the key elements for simulating the performance of such systems in a smaller scale laboratory environment is
the ability of projecting the precise intensity mask on the pupil plane. This mask often has binary (black or
transparent/reflective) patterns that mimic the secondary obscuration and spider design of the telescope. Precise
implementation of such intensity masks on the bench is important since studying effects such as “island/petaling
effect” are critically dependent on the correct down-scaling and precise representation of the spider structure.
Using a physical mask for such an application is very challenging since manufacturing and installing such fine
structure pieces are difficult and hard to use. It is also necessary to build a new physical mask for each telescope
system or scale that is desired for the experiment. In this paper, we introduce two methods of using a phase
only Liquid Crystal on Silicon Spatial Light Modulator (LCoS-SLM) device as an alternative option to precisely
and relatively easily inject the custom intensity mask into an optical bench. By implementing these methods on
the LOOPS bench AO facilities at LAM, we demonstrated that the contrast produced by both methods could
be better than 2% (dark/bright ratio), which is sufficient for representing pupil obscuration in the majority of
applications. We also show that by using one of these methods, it is possible to inject phase and binary intensity
mask simultaneously which could greatly increase the versatility and ease of use of an experimental AO setup."

The segments are initially misaligned in piston/tip/tilt with median inter-segment steps of several micrometers. We simulate a mirror with some missing segments and a telescope spider with large optical phase discontinuities across its six vanes. The physical optics simulation is validated by experiments on the LOOPS optical bench at LAM. The correct combination of step solutions is selected by maximum likelihood methods.

2021-01-19	INGOT Wavefront Sensor: from the optical design to a preliminary laboratory test	arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.07742	The Ingot wavefront sensor is a novel pupil-plane wavefront sensor, specifically designed to cope with the elongation typical of the extended nature of the Laser Guide Star (LGS). In the framework of the ELT, we propose an optical solution suitable for a Laser launch telescope, located outside the telescope pupil. In this paper, we present the current optical design, based on a reflective roof-shaped prism, which, at the level of the focal plane, splits the light from an LGS producing three beams. The three images of the telescope pupils can be then used for the retrieval of the first derivative of the wavefront. The 3D nature of such a device requires new alignment techniques to be determined theoretically and verified in the real world. A possible fully automated procedure, relying solely on the illumination observed at the three pupils, to align the prism to the image of the LGS is discussed. Careful attention needs to be put both on the telecentricity of the system and on the reference systems of the Ingot adjustments in the 3D space. This is crucial in order to disentangle all the possible misalignment effects. In this context, we devised a test-bench able to reproduce, in a scaled manner, the 3D illumination that the Ingot will face at the ELT, in order to validate the design and to perform preliminary tests of phase retrieval.

2021-07-01	The SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE)-II. Observations, data reduction and analysis, detection performances, and initial results	Astronomy & Astrophysics	"Context. In recent decades, direct imaging has confirmed the existence of substellar companions (exoplanets or brown dwarfs) on wide orbits (>10 au) around their host stars. In striving to understand their formation and evolution mechanisms, in 2015 we initiated the SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE), a systematic direct imaging survey of young, nearby stars that is targeted at exploring their demographics.
Aims. We aim to detect and characterize the population of giant planets and brown dwarfs beyond the snow line around young, nearby stars. Combined with the survey completeness, our observations offer the opportunity to constrain the statistical properties (occurrence, mass and orbital distributions, dependency on the stellar mass) of these young giant planets.
Methods. In this study, we present the observing and data analysis strategy, the ranking process of the detected candidates, and the survey performances for a subsample of 150 stars that are representative of the full SHINE sample. Observations were conducted in a homogeneous way between February 2015 and February 2017 with the dedicated ground-based VLT/SPHERE instrument equipped with the IFS integral field spectrograph and the IRDIS dual-band imager, covering a spectral range between 0.9 and 2.3 μm. We used coronographic, angular, and spectral differential imaging techniques to achieve the best detection performances for this study, down to the planetary mass regime.
Results. We processed, in a uniform manner, more than 300 SHINE observations and datasets to assess the survey typical sensitivity as a function of the host star and of the observing conditions. The median detection performance reached 5σ-contrasts of 13 mag at 200 mas and 14.2 mag at 800 mas with the IFS (YJ and YJH bands), and of 11.8 mag at 200 mas, 13.1 mag at 800 mas, and 15.8 mag at 3 as with IRDIS in H band, delivering one of the deepest sensitivity surveys thus far for young, nearby stars. A total of sixteen substellar companions were imaged in this first part of SHINE: seven brown dwarf companions and ten planetary-mass companions.These include two new discoveries, HIP 65426 b and HIP 64892 B, but not the planets around PDS70 that had not been originally selected for the SHINE core sample. A total of 1483 candidates were detected, mainly in the large field of view that characterizes IRDIS. The color-magnitude diagrams, low-resolution spectrum (when available with IFS), and follow-up observations enabled us to identify the nature (background contaminant or comoving companion) of about 86% of our subsample. The remaining cases are often connected to crowded-field follow-up observations that were missing. Finally, even though SHINE was not initially designed for disk searches, we imaged twelve circumstellar disks, including three new detections around the HIP 73145, HIP 86598, and HD 106906 systems.
Conclusions. Nowadays, direct imaging provides a unique opportunity to probe the outer part of exoplanetary systems beyond 10 au to explore planetary architectures, as highlighted by the discoveries of: one new exoplanet, one new brown dwarf companion, and three new debris disks during this early phase of SHINE. It also offers the opportunity to explore and revisit the physical and orbital properties of these young, giant planets and brown dwarf companions (relative position, photometry, and low-resolution spectrum in near-infrared, predicted masses, and contrast in order to search for additional companions). Finally, these results highlight the importance of finalizing the SHINE systematic observation of about 500 young, nearby stars for a full exploration of their outer part to explore the demographics of young giant planets beyond 10 au and to identify the most interesting systems for the next generation of high-contrast imagers on very large and extremely large telescopes.

2021-10-01	Three-sided pyramid wavefront sensor, part 1: simulations and analysis for astronomical adaptive optics	Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems	For ExAO instruments for the Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs), alternative architectures of WFS are under consideration because there is a tradeoff between detector size, speed, and noise that reduces the performance of GSMT-ExAO wavefront control. One option under consideration for a GSMT-ExAO wavefront sensor is a three-sided PWFS (3PWFS). The 3PWFS creates three copies of the telescope pupil for wavefront sensing, compared to the conventional four-sided PWFS (4PWFS) which uses four pupils. The 3PWFS uses fewer detector pixels than the 4PWFS and should therefore be less sensitive to read noise. Here we develop a mathematical formalism based on the diffraction theory description of the Foucault knife edge test that predicts the intensity pattern after the PWFS. Our formalism allows us to calculate the intensity in the pupil images formed by the PWFS in the presence of phase errors corresponding to arbitrary Fourier modes. We then use the Object Oriented MATLAB Adaptive Optics toolbox (OOMAO) to simulate an end-to-end model of an adaptive optics system using a PWFS with modulation and compare the performance of the 3PWFS to the 4PWFS. In the case of a low read noise detector, the Strehl ratios of the 3PWFS and 4PWFS are within 0.01. When we included higher read noise in the simulation, we found a Strehl ratio gain of 0.036 for the 3PWFS using Raw Intensity over the 4PWFS using Slopes Maps at a stellar magnitude of 10. At the same magnitude, the 4PWFS RI also outperformed the 4PWFS SM, but the gain was only 0.012 Strehl. This is significant because 4PWFS using Slopes Maps is how the PWFS is conventionally used for AO wavefront sensing. We have found that the 3PWFS is a viable wavefront sensor that can fully reconstruct a wavefront and produce a stable closed-loop with correction comparable to that of a 4PWFS, with modestly better performance for high read-noise detectors.

2022-10-01	Three-sided pyramid wavefront sensor, part II: preliminary demonstration on the new comprehensive adaptive optics and coronagraph test instrument testbed	Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems	The next generation of giant ground and space telescopes will have the light-collect-ing power to detect and characterize potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets using high-contrast imaging for the first time. This will only be achievable if the performance of the Giant Segment Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs) extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems are opti-mized to their full potential. A key component of an ExAO system is the wavefront sensor (WFS), which measures aberrations from atmospheric turbulence. A common choice in current and next-generation instruments is the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). ExAO systems require high spatial and temporal sampling of wavefronts to optimize performance and, as a result, require large detectors for the WFS. We present a closed-loop testbed demonstration of a three-sided pyramid wavefront sensor (3PWFS) as an alternative to the conventional four-sided pyramid wavefront (4PWFS) sensor for GSMT-ExAO applications on the innovative comprehensive adaptive optics and coronagraph test instrument (CACTI). The 3PWFS is less sensitive to read noise than the 4PWFS because it uses fewer detector pixels. The 3PWFS has further benefits: a high-quality three-sided pyramid optic is easier to manufacture than a four-sided pyramid. We describe the design of the two components of the CACTI system, the adaptive optics simulator and the PWFS testbed that includes both a 3PWFS and 4PWFS. We detail the error budget of the CACTI system, review its operation and calibration procedures, and discuss its current status. A preliminary experiment was performed on CACTI to study the performance of the 3PWFS to the 4PWFS in varying strengths of turbulence using both the raw intensity and slopes map signal processing methods. This experiment was repeated for a modulation radius of 1.6 and 3.25 λ∕D. We found that the performance of the two wavefront sensors is comparable if modal loop gains are tuned.

2024-08-27	Advancements in estimating differential pistons for the Extremely Large Telescope using deep learning	Proc. SPIE 13097, Adaptive Optics Systems IX, 130974Y	"As the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) nears operational status, the focus is made on maximizing its capabilities to produce the best possible images. Among other influential factors, the differential pistons – caused by the joint presence of spiders breaking the spatial continuity of the wavefront and low-order aberrations from various origins – significantly impact the overall image quality and must therefore be addressed. Our study is centered on utilizing Neural Networks (NN) to accurately estimate the ELT’s six differential pistons in the presence of turbulence residuals using a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS). The results of this work could be applied to instruments like HARMONI or MORFEO, which will be equipped with 2x2 SHWFS for their natural guide star wavefront sensing. In our earlier work, the use of ResNet networks fed with data covering all pupil/SHWFS rotation angles demonstrated success in piston estimation. In that study, a simplified atmospheric turbulence model was employed, consisting solely of turbulence residuals, implying perfect correction for frequencies below the deformable mirror’s cutoff frequency. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the network’s performance under more realistic atmospheric turbulence conditions relevant to the ELT. We show that the network can still extract differential piston information from single-frame images, while exhibiting increased uncertainty in its estimation. However, using 10-frame averaged images leads to a significant improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) performance. We conclude this work by addressing remaining open questions and outlining potential future research directions. These findings contribute to refining the NN models usage for cophasing applications, addressing alignment challenges, and enhancing ELT instrumentation performance.

2024-08-27	Enhancing space surveillance through the Unistellar collaborative observation program	Proc. SPIE 13094, Ground-based and Airborne Telescopes X, 1309455	The DOSSA (Decentralization of Space Situational Awareness) project, led by SpaceAble in collaboration with Unistellar and the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille, aims to enhance space surveillance through a collaborative effort involving amateur astronomers, researchers, and industrial networks, leveraging advanced technology and data collection to improve space situational awareness in an era of escalating satellite numbers. This project aims to create a comprehensive sky map of objects transiting around Earth. It benefits from a large dataset collected by the Unistellar telescope network, a global network comprised primarily of robotically controllable evScopes 1 and 2 telescopes, each featuring a 11.4 centimeter aperture diameter. We develop dedicated deep learning algorithms to account for the relatively compact diameters of the telescopes and to extend detection thresholds. Firstly, we use traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based classifiers to detect images including a satellite streak, and secondly, we use UNet to identify pixels affected by such streaks. Both neural networks are trained on realistic simulations generated using our optical Fourier simulation software, by combining observed sky backgrounds and synthetic satellite streaks spanning a wide range of orbital parameters. With this strategy, we reach excellent performance on the segmentation of images in test set, with a recall of 79.6% pixels belonging to the satellites masks, at a false positive rate of 0.001%. For 90% of streak pixels recovered by the neural networks, we obtain a precision of 96.3% on the predicted satellite masks. This exceeds the performance of non-ML algorithms and paves the way to measuring accurate satellite positions over broader magnitudes ranges and down to lower S/N, in order to increase the precision on their orbital parameters.
